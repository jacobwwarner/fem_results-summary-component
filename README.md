## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Building out this component helped me...
1: ... to see which element layouts can be accomplished with Grid vs Flexbox.
2: ... to understand how to use custom properties in CSS to write efficient, reusable code.
3: ... see how you can create a premade gradient to reuse across multiple components.
